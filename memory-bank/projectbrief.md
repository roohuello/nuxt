# Project Brief

## Project Overview
This is a Nuxt 4 application built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and modern web development practices. The project follows senior-level coding standards with a focus on SSR (Server-Side Rendering), performance, security, and maintainability.

## Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Nuxt 4
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with Composition API
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS with potential Tailwind integration via Nuxt UI
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Linting/Formatting**: Biome.js

## Project Structure
```
app/              # Main application code
  app.vue         # Root application component
  assets/         # Static assets (CSS, images, etc.)
  pages/          # Page components for routing
public/           # Static files served directly
server/           # Server-side code and API routes
```

## Key Requirements
1. Follow Nuxt 4 best practices for SSR-safe development
2. Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout
3. Use Vue 3 Composition API patterns
4. Leverage Nuxt UI components where appropriate
5. Maintain security best practices (proper input validation, secure configuration)
6. Implement proper error handling and accessibility
7. Follow the AI development rules specified in .clinerules/

## Goals
- Build a robust, maintainable Nuxt 4 application
- Demonstrate senior-level full-stack development practices
- Create reusable components and composables
- Implement proper state management with Pinia
- Ensure optimal performance and SEO
- Maintain clean, well-documented code

## Success Criteria
- Application runs without errors in both development and production
- Code follows all specified development rules and best practices
- Proper TypeScript typing with minimal `any` usage
- Clean, maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Good performance metrics and accessibility compliance
