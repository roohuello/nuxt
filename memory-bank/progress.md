# Progress

## Current Status
✅ Memory bank initialization in progress
✅ Core documentation files being established
✅ Project structure analyzed
✅ Development environment assessed

## What Works
- Basic Nuxt 4 project structure is in place
- TypeScript configuration is properly set up
- Development server can be started with `pnpm run dev`
- File-based routing system is functional
- Biome.js code quality tools are configured
- pnpm package management is working
