# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initializing the memory bank for the Nuxt 4 project. This involves setting up the core documentation files that will serve as the knowledge base for ongoing development work.

## Recent Changes
- Project structure analysis completed
- Memory bank directory created
- Core documentation files being established
- Project brief and product context documented

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining core memory bank files:
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md
   - progress.md
2. Review existing project files to understand current implementation
3. Identify areas for improvement based on AI development rules
4. Plan incremental enhancements to demonstrate best practices

## Active Decisions
- Following the hierarchical memory bank structure as specified
- Maintaining strict adherence to the AI development rules in .clinerules/
- Using TypeScript-first approach for all new development
- Leveraging Nuxt 4 built-in features (useFetch, useAsyncData, etc.)
- Implementing proper SSR patterns from the start

## Important Patterns
- Component separation (smart vs. dumb components)
- Composable usage for reusable logic
- Proper state management with Pinia
- Security-conscious configuration management
- Accessibility-first development approach

## Learnings & Insights
- Project is in early stages with basic structure in place
- Follows standard Nuxt 4 directory structure
- Has proper TypeScript configuration
- Includes Biome.js for code quality enforcement
- Ready for implementation of senior-level patterns and practices
